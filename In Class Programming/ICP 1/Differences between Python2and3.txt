Differences between Python 2 and 3

Python 2 the print command is a statement rather than a function.
Python 3 print function requires parentheses around the string to be printed.

Python 2 assumes all numbers entered without a decimal point are intended to be Integers.  If the user wants to have decimals in the results of a math evaluation (such as division) they need to include the decimal.
Python 3 can automatically type the result as a double.  If the result of two integers being divided is a decimal Python 3 will automatically convert the answer.

Python 3 patches a bug in the original Python code.  In earlier versions of Python, reusing the name of a global variable in list iteration can lead to reassigning the global variable.  

Python 3 removes the Python 2 requirement to mark Unicode strings with a u.  All strings are stored as Unicode strings in Python 3 by default.

The syntax for exception raising changed between Python 2 and 3.
